          <h3>Project 1</h3>
          <p>
            Smart Home Automation System:
            In this cutting-edge project, I developed a smart home automation system using Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors. The system allows users to control and monitor various aspects of their home, including lighting, temperature, and security, through a centralized mobile application. Leveraging MQTT protocol for efficient communication between devices, users can create custom automation routines and receive real-time updates. The presentation will showcase the user-friendly interface, the integration of smart devices, and the overall efficiency and convenience brought by this intelligent home automation solution.</p>

          <h3>Project 2</h3>
          <p>Urban Traffic Management System Using IoT and AI:
            This project focuses on designing an urban traffic management system that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) devices and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in cities. The system integrates traffic sensors, cameras, and traffic lights connected to a centralized control system. AI algorithms analyze real-time traffic data to predict traffic patterns, identify congestion hotspots, and dynamically adjust traffic signal timings to alleviate congestion and improve traffic flow. The project aims to enhance urban mobility, reduce travel times, and minimize environmental impacts associated with traffic congestion. Evaluation of the system's effectiveness will involve simulation studies and field trials in a real urban environment.</p>
